# Architecture Documentation (often) Sucks

In real life systems we find well-written code, motivated teams
and productive systems - but quite often the knowledge
about software architecture is hidden in single brains, scattered code
or simply lost.

Several typical problems hinder many software projects - which
arc42 can help to reduce or eliminate very effiently with low effort.

### Not Existing or Outdated
The first problem is missing or outdated documentation:

There's documentation, created somewhere in the past. Rumors say it had been
correct a long time ago, the original authors unknown or vanished. Such _historical_
artifacts only waste disk space and provide no value at alll, for nobody.

### Chaotic
The second problem is chaotic and confusing documentation.

Such documentation has often been created without clear purpose,
by various people without proper coordination.

Such _documentation anarchy_ is hard to maintain and is generally considered
more harmful than helpful, due to the lack of appropriate structure.

### Too Much
You can hide any needle in a sufficiently large haystack - and nobody will
be able to efficiently find it in there.

Such piles of documents might seem impressive at first - unless someone tries
to find (or update!) specific information.

### Painful

From typical developers' perspective, documentation is often a pain:
formalities, inapropriate tools and formats, unclear instructions on
what and how to document...


# arc42 makes documentation efficient and effective

arc42 has a clear, simple and effective structure to document and
communicate your software system. Is is optimized for understandability
and adequacy. arc42 naturally guides you to explain any kind of
architecture information or decision in an understandable way,
easy to maintain.


## Painless documentation

arc42 users **like** the _understandability_, that mainly results from its standardized
  structure.

But what they really **love** is the _manageable effort_ it takes to create and
maintain arc42-based architecture documentation. We call it “_painless documentation_”,
using the arc42 template does not require additional effort:

*	You only describe things that your stakeholders really have to know.
*	You explain facts and issues that are necessary to understand the system or
individual design decisions.
*	You only keep track of important architecture decision that you had to
make anyhow.

## Lean and lightweigt

arc42 is intended to be a lightweight tool that can easily be adapted to
your specific need.
