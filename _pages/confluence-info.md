You're looking for the arc42 Confluence?

Since January 2017 our public confluence is hosted
in the [Atlassian Cloud](https://arc42-template.atlassian.net/), not on our own site.

You will **NOT** be automatically redirected - so you have to
click the link or copy/paste the following link:

#### [https://arc42-template.atlassian.net/](https://arc42-template.atlassian.net/)


Have fun!
