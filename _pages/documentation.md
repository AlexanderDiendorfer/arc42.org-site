    excerpt: 'predefines sections for the relevant aspects of software architectures. Use them according to specific needs. Intentionally leave sections empty... Compare the arc42 sections to the _drawers_ of a cabinet. arc42 contains 12 such drawers, each one specialized to hold a specific kind of information about the architecture of a system. The meaning of these arc42 drawers is easy to understand.'

  excerpt: 'We want to warn you about one risk when using arc42 template:
  one could interpret the template as a form and could be tempted to
  fill every field . We seriously dislike terms like “fill in” and “form”.
   (The term „template zombies“ has been coined by Tom DeMarco, Peter Hruschka et al.
  in their award-winning book „Adrenalin Junkies and Templates Zombies“ (Dorset House 2007))'

# What is arc42?

arc42 offers a clear, simple and effective structure to document and
communicate your software system.

arc42 is optimized for understandability and adequacy. It naturally guides you to explain any kind of architecture information or decision in an understandable way.

|6. Runtime View|12. Glossary |


# arc42 supports ANY kind of system or project

arc42 supports your style of working, your domain and your technology.
Apply it in agile, lean or formal projects - you decide.


## Painless documentation

arc42 users **like** the _understandability_, that mainly results from its standardized
  structure.

But what they really **love** is the _manageable effort_ it takes to create and
maintain arc42-based architecture documentation. We call it “_painless documentation_”,
using the arc42 template does not require additional effort:

*	You only describe things that your stakeholders really have to know.
*	You explain facts and issues that are necessary to understand the system or
individual design decisions.
*	You only keep track of important architecture decision that you had to
make anyhow.


{% include feature_row id="form_no_thanx" type="right" %}


arc42 is intended to be a lightweight tool that can easily be adapted to
your specific need. It is not nearly a “fill-in all fields” form.
